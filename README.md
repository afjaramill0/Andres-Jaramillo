# Andres-Jaramillo
Introduction
My name is Andres Jaramillo and I was born in Colombia but raised in Puerto Rico. I lived in Puerto Rico for about 14-15 years and moved here to the US back in 2015. I've lived most of the time here in NC but I have been moving around. I'm on my last year here in Wake Tech.
